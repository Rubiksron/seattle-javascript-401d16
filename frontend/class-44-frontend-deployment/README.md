## Overview
#### Content Delivery Network
#### Transport Layer Security (TLS / SSL)
The Transport Layer Security was previously the Secure Socket Layer, and they are both commonly refered to as SSL. SSL is a crypographic protocol that provides secure communications over a computer network. SSL enables communications between computers to be private. It does this by using asymetric cyphers to encrypt data before sending it across the network.
###### Asymetric Cyper
An asymetric cyper is a cryptographic algorythem that uses seporate keys for encrypting and decrypting data. These keys are often refered to as public and private keys. The public key is used to encrypt the data and the private key is used to decrypt the data. An analogy for this might be if a store owner had a two types of keys keys to her store several for locking it up (copys of a public key), and one for opening it (a private key). All her employes could have access to the key that locks the store, but once the store was locked she would be the only one that could open it.
